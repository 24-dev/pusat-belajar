Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

It is important to remember, autogenerated collapsed sidebar title will coming from the folder name.
So if you need the correct capitalization, just rename the folder like the title.
